## An Eportfolio for Andrew Woodruff

### Included are a selection of works I have created or been a part of their creation
* Bork
  * A Java implementation of the Zork text based adventure game.
  * I learned how object oriented design helps create dynamic function applications.
  * If I were to do the project again I would create a better schedule for the implementation process.
* Club Website
  * A Website created for a fictional School Club.
  * I learned web-development with Python and PostgreSQL as well as the benefits of version control.
  * If I were to do the project again I would have picked a more useful website to create, possible something that I could utilize after the class was finished.
* Honors Evaluation Project
  * A website developed for the UMW Honors Program.
  * I learned about agile development and managing group workflow with applications like a taskboard.
  * If I were to do the project again I would make a more pessimistic estimate of my and my groups time for task completion and budget more time to throughly finish implemented all requirements.
* Project Plan
  * A project plan document for the Honors Evaluation Project.
  * I learned about the creation of and estimates for tasks in the development of a schedule for a project.
  * If I were to do the project again I would have prefered to meet with our client to get more feedback on what the priority of requirements was.
* User Interface Design
  * A User Interface Design document for the Honors Evaluation Project.
  * I learned about interacting with a Focus Group to gather feedback for the usability of an application.
  * If I were to do this usability study again I would like to gather a larger and wider array of feedback, i.e. from a more varied group of prospect users.
